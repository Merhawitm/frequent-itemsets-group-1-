## Project Overview

This project explores frequent itemset mining using the Apriori algorithm on simulated supermarket transaction data. We focus on identifying Frequent Itemsets, Closed Frequent Itemsets, and Maximal Frequent Itemsets. The code is fully commented, with each group member's contributions clearly marked.
